# üîê Django API Logger

A powerful Django package for **API logging, monitoring, and security**.  
This package helps developers track API requests/responses, detect vulnerabilities, monitor suspicious activities, and get proactive alerts before customers face downtime.

## üöÄ Features
- **API Logging**
  - Logs all API requests & responses with metadata.
  - Measures processing time for each request.
  - Masks sensitive fields (e.g., passwords, tokens).

- **Security & Vulnerability Monitoring**
  - Detects unauthorized login attempts & brute force attacks.
  - Monitors suspicious payloads (e.g., SQL injection patterns).
  - Tracks abnormal API usage & suspicious sessions.

- **File Upload Monitoring**
  - Restricts file types (whitelisted extensions).
  - Enforces file size limits.
  - Blocks suspicious filenames (e.g., `.php.jpg`).

- **Alerting System**
  - Threshold-based alerts (high latency, error spikes, suspicious traffic).
  - Notifications via Email, Slack, Webhooks, etc.
  - Priority levels: Critical, Warning, Info.

- **Dashboard & Reports**
  - Django Admin integration.
  - Logs, charts, and suspicious activity reports.
